note: I did this coding to monitor resource utilization such as ram and processor of the instance on shared instance, it turned out you are only allowed to utilise 51MB of ram but when you check this way it rather shows 64gb of ram, so you cant make any decision on this data and your cant prevent your server from crashing because of overloading, if you ended up here please let me know if you found a successful way. thanks.
